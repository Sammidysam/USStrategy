USStrategy
==========

Nathan and I's strategy game, programmed in Java.  It will use Slick2d for graphics with maybe a tint of LWJGL.
The plot behind this is that after years of the US getting nothing done because the government has 50% republicans and 50% democrats, states get fed up.
Some states decide it's time to go.
It will be somewhat like Europa Universalis III in the GUI.
Politican movement will be a factor.  Say Texas leaves.  Most likely the Republicans will take control of the new country.  Democrats will be forced to nearby states, which will affect their decisions.
States that have the same party will get along better.
New England will likely become it's own country since we all know Rhode Island would die on their own.
The Green, America First, Constitutional, and Libertarian parties will have some say and could gain control in some states.
No country will have Democrats AND Republicans since at least one will be phased out.  Thus, those minor parties can take advantage.
Alaska might get pulled in by Canada.

The end!
